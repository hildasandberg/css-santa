# Sprint 4 – :santa: Santa Competition :santa:

Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
The students by their laptops, awaited their next quest,
The task to build old St Nick, Santa, with just CSS.

Today's assignment is all about having fun and getting into the Christmas spirit. Your task is to create a image of Santa using ONLY HTML and CSS. This is also a competition and the best looking Santa, voted for by the class, gets to receive the annual Santa competition price. GAME ON!

## How to complete this assignment

### Rules

You need to construct an image of a Santa using ONLY HTML and CSS. A tip is use lot's of divs that you give colors and shapes – absolute positioning will be your bff in this. Everything you can do with CSS is allowed - GO NUTS. The more the merrier!

One cannot draw Santa on an empty stomach, so to you help you out, we'll have some Glögg, some beers, and a nice Christmas lunch. Ho ho ho.

At 2 PM the latest you need to deploy your Santa and post it in a PM to Damien on Slack. We will then later start with the anonymous voting. Good luck!

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you will have a greater understanding on how to use HTML and CSS to create images. Having simple shapes coded instead of using an image can be beneficial in terms of optimisation and responsiveness. Also, we hope you have some fun and get into a festive spirit.
